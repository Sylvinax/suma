         A merge in CollabNet Subversion is like a fancy diff + apply patch operation.  You provide the merge process with the information about what two things to compare, and then the differences between those two things are applied to your local project.  The most common merge operation is to merge one or more selected revisions from one location to another.&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have this information, you can move on to the next step.

         Before merging, you must <b>checkout</b> the project you wish to merge into and bring it into your workspace. You can do this either via the import wizard or by adding your repository from the CollabNet      perspective.

         In the navigator, right-click on the project and select <b>Team</b>
      &gt; <b>Merge</b> and fill out the information requested in the dialog.  Remember, you are providing CollabNet Subversion with the information of what changes you want to merge into the local project.  The most common merge scenario is to merge one or more specific revisions.  To do this, enter or select the URL where the changes occurred, such as the URL to trunk.  Then click the Show Log button and select the revision(s) in the dialog.  Then just click OK and CollabNet Subversion will perform the merge.

         CollabNet Subversion will perform the merge in your working copy.  Generally, it will be able to automatically merge most changes and you just need to review and test the changes.  If it cannot merge the changes, it will mark the file as conflicted.  This will show up in the file decorators as well as in the Problems view.&lt;br /&gt;
You can right-click on a conflict in the Problem view and use the Quick Fix option.  This will give you choices about resolving the conflicts. &lt;br /&gt;
Once you have resolved any conflicts, use the <b>Team &gt; Mark Resolved</b> option to let CollabNet Subversion know that you have resolved the conflict.

         Right-click on the project and select <b>Team</b> &gt; <b>Synchronize with
      Repository</b> and then commit all the changes to the repository. This
      step finalizes the transfer of the changes from the workspace to the repository, and finalizes the merge.
