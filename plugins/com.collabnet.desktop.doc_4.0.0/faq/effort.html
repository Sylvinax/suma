  <h1 class="title topictitle1">How do you measure "effort?"</h1>

  
  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Effort is a uniform span of time for measuring work on your product. Defining the unit
    of effort is an essential part of planning your work. </p>


    <p class="p">
      <span class="keyword">TeamForge</span>
       shows you the effort that has been
      estimated, and actually expended, for each artifact. Parent
      artifacts can automatically add up these effort figures from their child artifacts’ effort
      figures. </p>

    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> When a tracker is disabled, artifacts from that tracker do
				not contribute to the effort totals calculated for any planning folder they are
				in.</div>

    <p class="p">The unit of effort should be something that makes sense in your environment. <span class="keyword">TeamForge</span> does
      not require any particular unit. Your unit of effort might be hours per person, days, weeks,
      or something else. (If you are using a scrum-based project methodology, you may have opted to
      measure effort in relative terms, using story points, in which case you can leave the
        <span class="ph uicontrol">Effort</span> fields blank.)</p>

    <p class="p">For example, some teams use the "ideal hour" as their standard unit of effort. To define an
      ideal hour, consider all the activities in a standard work day that must be done but don't
      directly contribute to development: installing and configuring tools, eating lunch, responding
      to email and instant messages, providing customer support, etc. For every hour of direct
      development work, how much time goes into these activities, on the average? If the answer is
      about a half hour, then your ideal hour is 1.5 clock hours. </p>

    <p class="p">Now consider a task that you judge to represent about four hours of direct development work.
      The value you'll enter in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Effort</span> field is 6, because for each hour
      of direct development you'll need an extra half hour to make that development work possible. </p>

    <p class="p">In an environment with a lot of overhead — for example, a group that relies on a very
      complex tool set — your ideal hour might equal two clock hours, or perhaps much more. This is
      not in itself a problem: the point is not to suppress needed activities, but to plan
      realistically, in order to reduce the need for routine scheduling adjustments and to forecast
      more reliably. </p>

    <p class="p">(However, when units of effort seem radically out of line with reality, this may be a clue
      that something in the environment could be better optimized.)</p>
    
    
    <div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> To make your tracking easier, consider having <span class="keyword">TeamForge</span> automatically generate
      a running total of estimated effort for a whole hierarchy of user stories or tasks.</div>
