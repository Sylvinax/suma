    <div class="body taskbody"><p class="shortdesc">Defining scope is an iterative, interactive process<span class="ph"> for the product owner</span>. As you go through it, you'll
        find elements of your scope expanding, shrinking or changing shape in response to feedback
        from analyzing and planning out the work.</p>

        <div class="section context">
            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> It's a good idea to get the feature definition process under way <em class="ph i">before</em>
                setting up planning folders (see <a class="xref" href="createplanningfolder.html" title="When you've thought through your plan, express it in one or more planning folders.">Create a planning folder</a>), because defining
                features gives you the raw material for your planning process.</div>

        </div>

        <ol class="ol steps"><li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">Before you get started, you'll do some kind of user research, even if it's only
                    a few phone calls, to get an idea of the needs of the customers you hope to
                    satisfy. Express these needs and desires as stories about what a user can do
                    with your product. Then create an artifact for each user story you identify. </span>
                  A user story describes the situation after your product has been launched:
                    What can the user do now that they couldn't do before? <div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> For best
                        results, your user story artifact should be limited to a clear description
                        of the capability you want in the product. Remember that a user story is not
                        an implementation plan. Details about the implementation will be recorded in
                        the user story artifact, but when you write a user story, try to leave the
                        implementation up to the developer who will be responsible for
                it.</div>

            </li>
<li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">You may want to define one or more fictional users who resemble the real-life
                    users of your product. This can help simplify and focus your thinking. </span>
            </li>
<li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">Use the Priority field to express your opinion of how important the story is to
                    the user. In general, the most eagerly desired capabilities will be addressed
                    first. (During implementation planning, your Priority setting will be used as
                    one input in summing up the effort involved in each priority level.) </span>
            </li>
<li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">Make it as clear as you can at the outset what degree of functionality is
                    acceptable. For example, if your team is creating an airplane, how high must it
                    be able to fly? How far must it go before refueling? How many passengers must it
                    carry? Stating your acceptance criteria concretely helps reduce the time needed
                    for ongoing reviews and changes. </span>
